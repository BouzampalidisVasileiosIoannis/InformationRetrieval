# SongInformationSearchEngine

This project is implemented by the undergraduate students:
-Vasileios Ioannis Bouzampalidis
-Konstantinos Papadopoulos

For the Information Retrieval course MYE003 of the Undergraduate Program in Computer Science And
Engineering course of the University of Ioannina.

*Description*
This project is an application that allows the user to search for song titles,lyrics and artists using Lucene.

*Data Format*
The loaded data for our application will be in .csv format.
We decided to obtain our data from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/ , where we found the dataset: spotify_millsongdata.csv, containing 57651 entries in alphabetical order. The entries consist of three fields each occupying one column. The artist name occupies the first, the song title the second and the lyrics the third.

**Application Design**

*The following description  is still in the early phases of development and is subject to  change*

*Goal and Functionality*

The main goal of our application is to provide users with the ability to search for specific artists, song titles, or lyrics using a query input in the terminal.

*Data Analysis and Indexing*

To achieve this functionality, we have implemented a custom *Indexer* class based on the IndexWriter class of the Lucene library. The Indexer class contains fields for various Lucene objects, including *Directory*, *Analyzer*, *IndexWriterConfig*, and *IndexWriter*. The *Indexer* object requires the specification of the 'indexingPath' parameter to initialize the *Directory* field using the *FSDirectory* sub-class. Moreover, the remaining fields are initialized within the constructor.

The primary function of this class is achieved by the **loadFromCSV** method. Using the 'csvPath' and 'myIndexer' parameter, the method opens the csv file, reads it line by line and stores the entries in the corresponding variables namely 'artist', 'song', 'title'. The tokenization is accomplished through the creation of a new *Document* object in which, a new *TextField* for each attribute is added. Every new document created, is added to 'myIndexer' field. When every line is processed, every change is finallized by calling the **commit** method. The method is terminated by closing 'myIndexer' object and displaying a message indicating the successful completion of data import.

Additionally, this class provides auxiliary methods, namely **addDoc**, **deleteDoc**, and getters to assist in the manipulation of the index. 

*Query Parsing and Searching* 

The *QueryHandler* class is responsible for handling user queries and returning the corresponding Lucene queries based on the user's input. It has a constructor that takes a *QueryParser* as a parameter, and a **getQuery** method that prompts the user to enter their query, parses it, and returns a corresponding Lucene *Query*.

The **getQuery** method takes the user's input, splits it into two parts based on the first occurrence of ":" character, and uses the first part as the field type and the second part as the search phrase. If the search phrase consists of only one word, a *TermQuery* object is created and returned. Otherwise, if the search phrase consists of multiple words, a *PhraseQuery* object is created and returned, which matches documents containing the search phrase in the specified field type.

The *Searcher* class is tasked with handling user queries and performing search operations within the Lucene-based search engine. It plays a crucial role in executing searches and retrieving relevant results based on the user's search. The class features a constructor that takes a *QueryHandler* object, an index path, and a CSV path as parameters. An essential method of the *Searcher* class is the **search** method. This method accepts a query string as input and facilitates the search process. It leverages the capabilities of the underlying components, including the *IndexSearcher*, *Analyzer*, and *QueryHandler*, to execute the search query against the Lucene index. To enhance result visibility, the method employs a *Highlighter* object to highlight matching terms in the retrieved documents. The highlighted results are formatted in HTML for better presentation.

*Query Results Presentation*

The presentation of the search results and the submission of queries are now facilitated through a web page implemented with Spring Boot. Initially, the user is presented with a form to submit their query, followed by the display of search results in the form of a list, with matching items highlighted in bold.

| ABBA        | That's Me   | Are you sure you want to hear more what if I ain't worth the while not the style you'd be looking for if I'm sweet tonight things look different in the morning light I'm jealous and I'm proud if you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry. That's me are you sure you want to hear more Would I be the one you seek Mild and meek like the girl next door Don't you realize I may be an angel in disguise It's lonely to be free But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry That's me I don't believe in fairy-tales Sweet nothings in my ear But I do believe in sympathy That's me, you see Are you sure you want to hear more Won't you have a drink with me Just to see you're not really sore I can't help my ways I'm just not the girl to hide my face I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry That's me There's a special love Like an eagle flying with a dove I'll find it in the end If I keep on searching, but until then I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry That's me|
| ABBA | The Day Before You Came | I must have left my house at eight, because I always do My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due I must have read the morning paper going into town And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so The usual place, the usual bunch And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained The day before you came I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two And at the time I never even noticed I was blue I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school The train back home again Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame The day before you came I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then I must have read a while The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim The day before you came And turning out the light I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain The day before you came

| Adele | Need You Know | Picture perfect memories, Scattered all around the floor. Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it anymore. And I wonder if I ever cross your mind. For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now. Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now. Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door. Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before. And I wonder if I ever cross your mind. For me it happens all the time. It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk, And I need you now. Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now. Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all. It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now. And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now. I just need you now. Oh baby I need you now. |

| Chicago | Bigger Than Elvis | Come, let's talk just you and meFor once just let me be.The little boy you used to know.Relive that summer's bliss.Cause they came no more like this.Those were the days,The days when love was still in style.[Chorus]All I ever dreamed I'd beIs what you are to me.Bigger than Elvis.And for all the missing years,A memory reappears.Bigger than Elvis.I saw you on TV.The king, you were to me.Could you feel me watching you?At times my heart got mad,Only heroes are allowedTo run free, that they could come back inside of me.[Chorus]We know the sadness of goodbyesMust be the one that's bringing tears to your child's eyes.Oh, from now on I'll walk with youMaking music like you do.Would you believe I always knew?You were never hard to takeIn some mysterious wayBigger than ElvisAnd for all the missing yearsYour memory reappearsBigger than Elvis.Now I've found the missing years,Forgotten all my tears.I've found the missing years. |
